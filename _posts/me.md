I'm Pablo, a (web) programmer and this is my website. Professionally I've worked mostly with Angular, but from time to time I like to mess around with Python, React, Godot and a few others. Besides computers and programming I also love listening (and pretending to play) music, playing video-games and reading books. I also have fun with some gardening and taking random pictures. Oh, I also like dogs, of course.

### Why did you make a website?
Why not?

### Some hobby projects I've made
- [RR Tools](https://rr-tools.eu) (Angular & [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.rrtools.app))
- [pablo bot](https://t.me/rrpablobot) (Python telegram bot)
- [This website](https://www.pablob.eu/) (Next.js/React)
- [Banana Spleet](https://github.com/pbl0/banana_spleet) (Python)
- [Lambda-rr](https://pbl0.github.io/lambda-rr/) (Jekyll)
