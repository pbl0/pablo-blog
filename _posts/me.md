I'm Pablo, a programmer and this is my website. Professionally I've worked mostly with Angular, but from time to time I also mess around with Python, React, Godot and a few others. Besides computers and programming I also love [listening](/music) (and sometimes pretending to play) music, playing video-games and reading books. I also have fun with some gardening and [taking random pictures](https://instagram.com/hipi__hapa). Oh, I also like dogs, of course.

### Why did you make a website?
Why not?

### [Some hobby projects I've made](./code)

### Some fancy stats

### My best friend (Amora)

### Where the source?

If you really want to check the source code you can [click here](https://github.com/pbl0/pablo-blog). But be aware, this is one of my first React (NextJS) projects so the code could be (and probably is) a bit too messy and poorly documented, so make sure to bring an umbrella.
